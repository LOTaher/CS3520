Hi instructor! 

The employee account username and password is being read from the 'credentials.txt' file. 

The pseudocode can be found in the 'pseudocode.txt' file.

I have pre-populated the saved manifest ('saved_manifest.txt') with a few passengers for some dummy data to being testing my program.

Thank you!
